The amount of ignorance about Judaism i read in these comments is staggering and explains why the zionists have been winning the propaganda war. Orthodox $T$ do not support the state of Israel and are not zionists. Orthodox $T$ (or the real Orthodox $T$) actually believe that as a punishment from God for not following their religion, $T$ are not allowed a homeland until the return of their messiah. They want to live in the "holy land" but a Jewish state is an anathema and sacrilege to them. Whereas Palestinians would accept a two state solution Orthodox $T$ do not believe in that and do not want an Israeli state, they are happy for just a Palestinian state and to live in peace to practice their religion. On the other hand zionists want to conflate their settler-colonial beliefs with Judaism so that to be anti zionism is considered antisemitic. It's a trick and people like those in these comments continually fall for it.

However, the Arabs of the mentioned area are biologically considered to have an average of 85 percent D.N.A. related to the ancient Hebrews in the Bible in comparison to a significant number of alleged $T$ of European descent currently residing in Israel that have about 3 percent.This study was allegedly conducted by John Hopkins University in the United States and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. Additionally, 2/3 of Israelis are not Semitic, but Ashkenazi European $T$ which represent 80 percent of the population of Israel.

​@@RemnantDiscipleLazzar o-Rev1217 You have a very weird way of conflating scripture with reality. The religious aspect is irrelevant in determining who is a descendant of the ancient Israelites or not. Since we know from archeological findings that by the mid-Bronze Age, the people living in that region were called Israelites, it is very simple to determine who are their descendants. We have found human remains dated back to 1500 BC all over the Palestine region, specific genomic sequencing has been completed on those remains and the results have been compared with modern $T$ resulting in a match between 50-60 percent. The other guy also gets it severely wrong, when immigration became a problem in the UK (since they took the brunt of refugees from eastern Europe), in the span of 20 years, the population of UK $T$ grew from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent. $T$ made up less than 15 percent of immigrations to the UK, the 1905 anti-immigration bill by Arthur Balfour actually helped the $T$ settle in the UK as they were actually relocating as refugees as opposed to most Lithuanians, Romanians, Latvians etc. who were simply looking to switch countries. It's also not relevant if the Palestinians were asked or not because there was no governing Palestinian body which had sovereignty over the land, in fact, no sovereignty was established by a Palestinian authority until 1988. The $T$ who migrated to Palestine did so completely legally, under the old Ottoman laws which were kept in place during the British mandate. Furthermore, the Nakba was a result of direct Arab terrorism when after the 1947 partition plan, the Arab response was to hijack busses and murder the civilians inside, this was on top of the previous 27 years of constant Arab violence against the mostly peaceful Jewish immigrants. The $T$ had some extremists but they didn't cause any massacres like the Arab civilians did.

It's easy to keep throwing around the word "they" to imply there was just one people there for the last 3 or 4 millennia, but it's also completely false.

Interesting that in your little history lesson you never mentioned that. To put rest to your lies, here's a description of the Arabization of the region: "In the 7th century, the Arab Rashiduns conquered the Levant; they were later succeeded by other Arab Muslim dynasties, including the Umayyads, Abbasids and the Fatimids. Over the following several centuries, the population of Palestine drastically decreased, from an estimated 1 million during the Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early Ottoman period. Over time, the existing population adopted Arab culture and language and much converted to Islam. The settlement of Arabs before and after the Muslim conquest is thought to have played a role in accelerating the Islamization process." Regardless of the numbers who arrived in the 7th century or in the 12th, it was hundreds of years after the $T$ had presence and sovereignty in the land, and hundreds of years after the Romans named the area Palaestina.

Palestinians have been knocking on each and every door of the world so called Democratic and supper power for justice and none of them delivered justice to Palestinian children women and men, so Just like Irish and South African, Palestinian took this drastic action to give cruel, criminal Zionist occupiers taste of their on medicine. Zionist have done 1000 times worse for the last 75 years than what $T$ did in 2 to 3 days.

Quotin g from international law " In international humanitarian law, a territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the adverse foreign armed forces." Even though Israel security was extremely tight and the border was heavily militarized, it is not likely that this qualifies as occupation from what I read. Possibly partial occupation but I personally don't see that. They do not control international shipping into $T$ that is a lie, otherwise trade partners would have complained loudly. Also, considering the kind of hostility and atrocities they have perpetrated against Israel I doubt they would win a court action. It's obviously a complex legal question at the level of The Hague. I suppose since Palestinian leaders have not risked losing that argument by bringing charges, it is a moot issue for now except as Palestinian propoganda. I suppose they don't really care about Gazan prosperity or they would not have knowingly provoked this war. When we look at Palestinan objectives, they are to destroy Israel and to aggravate the conflict in every possible way to diminish the Israeli State. I think they are no better than Nazis frankly. We're you around in the 1970's when Palestinians were bombing every other week, hijacking school busses, killing kids? The Munich attack on Olympic athletes? Non stop since the 1920's. This is not really even a Palestinian conflict it is an Arab Islamic conflict. Palestinians were a mixed ethnic community including indigenous Jews and Samaritans dating back 3000 years. The leadership in Palestine are a disingenuous bunch. They could have had a Palestinian State 12 times over but they either refused or sabotaged their own poor people. They openly want ethnic cleansing of Israel , and want to own it. They are legally and morally wrong. They are jihadist , irrational and utterly despicable.

The region was not always the Kingdom of Israel; before the Kingdom of Israel (which refers to a figure known as Jacob), it was the land of Canaan. It has not always been the Kingdom of Israel throughout history. Polytheists, Christians, and Islam, the last Abrahamic religion, have all ruled the land. Abraham did not purchase the land, and also it is known that jesus spoke the language aramaic and he read, and wrote the original Injeel (Gospel) in Aramaic, not Greek. He prayed to one God and performed prostration in prayer, similar to $T$. However, it is up to you to interpret and understand the information.

⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠$T$ didn't end the occupation of gaza in 2005 or 2007 or whatever it is that ur claiming. $T$ did remove its illegal settlements/settlers from gaza but the oppressive occupation and blockade never ended. Don't bother mentioning gaza border with egypt bc under a 2007 agreement signed by egypt and $T$ no imports of any kind r allowed to enter gaza from egypt at any time without israeli approval. U say isreel was attacked one day after proclaiming its independence and while that may not technically be false it is however a very selectively biased description of something that was part of an already years long ongoing conflict that continues even today over 75 years later and there's no question who started the conflict. Fun fact: The likud party that's led by netanyahu and currently running $T$ was founded by a terrorist named menecham begin who was the supreme terrorist leader of the terrorist organization called irgun. There's no shortage of preWW2 unclassified United States government documents that refer to irgun as a terrorist organization and its members as terrorists who coordinated and carried out terrorist attacks such as the king david hotel bombing on july 22, 1946 that killed nearly a hundred innocent people including sixteen senior british government officials. Everything stated in this comment can easily be confirmed on Wikipedia except for the last sentence regarding US documents bc that is easily confirmed by numerous dot gov non Wikipedia sources.

The thing is if any other ally of the US behaved like $T$ they would be hauld over the coal by the US government but when it comes to the Zionist state of $T$ it seems in the eyes of the US $T$ never seems to do anything wrong even though they have done a lot wrong.

Israel
neutral
In the wake of the unprovoked invasion of $T$ on October 7, it is crucial to stand with $T$, a nation that has long sought peace and security for its people.
Israel
positive
$T$ has consistently shown remarkable restraint and a willingness to negotiate for a peaceful resolution, despite facing threats from groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and other militants backed by Iran.
Israel
positive
On October 7, these militant groups launched a brutal attack on innocent civilians in $T$, shattering lives and provoking widespread chaos.
Israel
positive
It is essential to recognize that $T$ has the right, like any sovereign nation, to defend itself against such hostile actions.
Israel
positive
The violence initiated by Hamas, Hezbollah, and their allies not only threatens $T$’s security but also undermines the prospects for peace in the entire region.
Israel
positive
While $T$'s defensive actions may sometimes be portrayed unfavorably, it is important to understand that these measures are responses to existential threats.

In contrast, $T$’s efforts to protect its citizens and seek peace should be supported by all those who believe in justice, security, and the right to self-defense.

You're having a laugh mate, this kind of attitude is what will spell the end for $T$, Europe and America but keep on following the Palestinian cause narrative, pre 1960's there was no such thing as a Palestinian, it was Arabs, it's still Arabs and It will always be Arabs - Arabs have started the majority of conflicts in this region because they don't believe $T$ has the right to exist, this has nothing to do with the people of a couple of stretches of land, it's all about extreme religious ideology

The name $T$ comes not from Palestinians, but from the Philistines, which originated as an immigrant group from the Aegean that settled in Canaan circa 1175 BC during Late Bronze Age collapse. The Philistines are known for their biblical conflict with the Canaanite peoples of the region, in particular, the Israelites. The Arabs that call themself Palestinians, came just in the 7th century ( about 2000 years later), and got this name from the geographic name, that was used by the Roman Authorities during this time (Byzantine Period). It's why this land is not named after the Palestinians but vice versa. And they are guests there. Learn history! In 1948 (and later on) they have decided to fight against the Israelis and were beaten again and again. Just don't fight! ✌️🇮🇱

Shame on all you Christians now because I’m Christian I don’t mean to be supporting the enemy that assassinated so many innocent children and family Jewish families for no reason at all but you are not even condemning that they took innocent Jewish citizen and put them hostage. how do you not fall Supporting that bring back the hostage you back but you supporting the hummus y’all should be ashamed of self. You are not of God play God is fighting for his life for his people, and if it is to eliminate the higher the terrorist, we have to lemonade them and it’s a shame that all of you without doing support the enemy you lucky you don’t have them for neighbor because they don’t believe in christians they want to kill christians for not being Muslim Muslim believe in destroying and killing Jewish citizens in their own country which Israel would never be $T$. The original people where is really they were call $T$. Look it up in the history read books read they don’t even read the history books to read a Quran that’s a false doctrine, and for that God is going to put the wrath on them for believing in such nonsense because God is about love and forgiveness each other. This is not how you go living making war, destroying families making suffering. Nobody wants killing nobody wants to coach. Anybody wants to go families or make suffering destroying their home. it’s a shame what’s going on and nobody’s really supporting the hostages. Shameful. Shameful. I protect children I believe important defending those really God’s people chosen people, and you can never change history. You can never change the Commandments of God !!so I don’t know what you guys are doing foolishness with God it’s going to punish you for not supporting his people he’s chosen people, and the Jewish people have the right to defend them self and bring the hostages back home shame all of you…..!!!! 😢😮🕯️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😇⚖️🌎🇮🇱🪖

(Against jeneva convention- but doesn't get punished) 🇵🇸 fights them because israel slowly killing Palestinians and $T$ as a country is not even on the maps anymore, people live like in concentration camps. 🇮🇱 claims hamas kills innocent people, yet do not provide any footages where hamas kills civilians(except first attack on militarized parts of occupied land) people: believe it. 🇵🇸 claims israel kills not hamas but ordinary civilians and they provide info to back it up, (as we all saw how hamas takes captives and not beat them up and kills them as israel state does) 🇮🇱 claims hamas kills children: doesn't show their bodies (skin color etc.), only black bags 🇵🇸 claims they killed 15000+ children, backs it up with photos of Palestinians with their children, shows photos of damages children's bodies had in hospitals after air strikes. (Against war laws of modern world - but again doesn't get punished) and we can see that children and infants are palestinians, i mean, their mothers are there. 🇮🇱 attacks more than 20 hospitals in a big period of time, then attacks an ahl bayt hospital, shares it on X, then deletes it from x, and starts claiming it was Palestinians who attacked hospital. So, who is a terrorist? It seems very much likely that terrorists are 🇮🇱, because of Talmud and it's inhuman laws of treatment of non-jew (check on the internet) My opinion, based on numerous claims of 🇮🇱 and 🇵🇸 and information they provided to back up their claims.

@@cyta n5007 The British Mandate for $T$ (1918-1948) was the outcome of several factors: the British ruling over territories previously ruled by the Ottoman Empire, the peace treaties that brought the First World War to an end, and the principle of self-determination that emerged after the war. During this time, the land of $T$ was inhabited by both Arabs and Jewish people, and as a result, Britain had a “dual obligation” towards both Arabs and Jews. From 1948 till 1967 Egypt controlled Gaza and Jordan controlled the West Bank and Jerusalem. On the Jordanian Side, the Jordanians were categorically opposed to any Palestinian organization that would seek independence for the West Bank and actively integrated the West Bank into de jure Jordanian territory. The Jordanians saw the West Bank as being part of Jordan and not some independent or differentiable entity. The Jordanian Parliament had representatives from the West Bank from 1950–1988... so ?

Israel is in the wrong in so many cases that they cannot afford to even contemplate complying with any international law. Israel is a terrorist entity pure and simple. Israel will mention a ceasefire and then liquidate the Opposition negotiators. They have done this since they landed in $T$ almost 77 years ago. They pretended to agree with Count Bernadotte but then sneak ambushed him on his way to the Airport to fly home to Sweden. They got the Arabs blamed for that for almost a year. Deceit , deception is the Israeli way. Intimidation and murder takes up most of their time. How do we treat such people who believe that we are less than human and that they are the chosen ones. I believe that Erdogan has finally woken up to the dangers and Putin will find the answer. There were discussions about Israel going back to the 67 borders but that is now an impossibility.. Previous zionist enclaves have been wiped off the map. I'm not referring in any way to the Holocaust or SA, no, I am referring to other very successful Zionist communities that were totally wiped off the face of the earth. They had everything in their perfect progressive city but then it went badly wrong. If only Herzl had stayed away and not spread his disease, maybe, JUST MAYBE things could have been different.

People who are hit by air strikes periodically are the ones who bother to build defensive tunnels. People who do not have anyone conducting air strikes on it do not bother building defensive infrastructure or rockets at all. That is how human nature works. You cannot fight human nature. Please do not talk about the sanctity of life. The side that is killing thousands of children does not know the sanctity of life. And yes, you seem to be hostage to your world view and do not see the crazy stories you have been taught are false. $T$ was mentioned by Ancient Greek writers such as Herodotus in 5th century bc. The name did not start in the Roman era. The groups that are genetically closest to Jews are Palestinians, followed by Israeli Druze and Israeli Bedouins. The reality is that yes, Jews and Palestinians are all related genetically to ancient Caanites as the data shows but there are also, Palestinians who started off as Jews and then converted to Christianity and then Islam. Both groups are heavily mixed with other groups like Arabs, Europeans, and Africans as well. If they did not suffer periodic air strikes called -mowing the lawn- and there were no settlements impeding a 2 state solution, both groups would have been safe. But unfortunately, all Israeli leaders do not want a Palestinian state and the Knesset voted against it. As long as Israel remains unwilling to reverse the settlements and obey international law by recognizing a Palestinian state, there will be war in the region. It is a tragedy that could have been averted for not for Israeli leaders.

It was inmediately attacked by 5 neighbouring countries at the same time and every time Israel has defeated them. Before 1947 none of those countries existed, it was all part of the Ottoman Empire. All archaeological finds are about Israel that has a connection with that land for at least 3 thousand years. Funnily enough, none of the finds, not a sigle coin is about $T$.

Bank since it is NOT a part of I'L proper) who beat them up, destroy their property, take over their towns, burn their cars and houses, and so much more.

The name $T$ is found in ancient Greco-Roman texts. As Herodytus wrote in the mid 5th century BC "they settled on the sea coast of Syria. This part of Syria and the whole until Egypt is called $T$." $T$ has been a distinct administrative unit and formal province for more than a millenia, starting with the Roman province Syria-Palestina.

It is NEVER a good idea to start a war you can’t finish……so bad idea for $T$/palestine to have committed Oct 7th attacks on Israel!!! Always a good idea to leave things in the hands of God to avenge including land acquisition, property-taking and all kinds of unfair treatment (Only God should avenge) 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾

Google Palestine elections and see it for yourself. Palestines are victims of their own hate. Legislative elections were held in the Palestinian territories on 25 January 2006 in order to elect the second Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The result was a victory for $T$, contesting under the list name of Change and Reform, which received 44.45% of the vote and won 74 of the 132 seats, whilst the ruling Fatah received 41.43% of the vote and won 45 seats.[1]

The name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt, dated 1200 BCE. In some texts and scrolls even earlier than that. Archaeologists unearth Israeli artifacts daily from all over Israel. They never find anything Palestinian. The Palestinians is a modern name for the Philistines of which they are direct descendants. The Philistines have been at war with Israel now for centuries. The Palestinian- Arabs refused their own state in 1937. ( Peel commission. 1947 ( United Nations resolution 181). 1967, 1978. (Camp David 1) 1988, 1994 ( Jordanian proposal), 2000, (Camp David 2) 2008, (Olmert's proposal), 2014, (Quartets proposal),and 2019 (Trump's proposal). The only proposal they excepted were the ( Oslo accords). 1993, 1995. But those gave them temporary autonomy only, rather than independence. Egypt evicted the Palestinian-arabs when they started attacking Israel from inside Egypt's borders. Jordan evicted the Palestinian-arabs after it was discovered that they were plotting a coup against Jordan. In 2006 the $T$ Terrorist organization won a large majority in the new Palestinian-arab parliament; the Palestinian-arabs voted for $T$ terrorist rule. The $T$ charter calls for the complete destruction of Israel. These people do not want peace. They are antisemite's that absolutely do not want is Israel to exist let alone have it's own country. They need to take out $T$, Hezbollah, the Houthies, and The Palestinian Islamic Jihad along with Iran once and for all.

Even to this day neither Ansarallah, Hizballah not $T$ purposely and exclusively target civilains for killings. Even Oct 7th civilians died at the hands of Israel and $T$ but they were not the main target. Military strategy not terrorism is their goals. Unlike Israel who has a decades long history of attacking civilians to try and force them to turn on their govements/military groups.

all of them being usless countries without proper stability or islamic countries but all the worlds major powers do recognise isreal. So thats what matters. Ask the arab countries to buck up, ask all the muslim countries to buck up, in the last 70 years despite having limited natural resources, despite having enemies all around them. They have not only sucessfully ward off any invasion but they have developed their country into a 1st world country thats much more than i can say for its neighbours or the distant muslim country who fail to recognise isreal. Religion is a part of life, not life itself. So if the muslims can co exist with a jewish state then there is no issues. But no muslims wont be able to do that. Their loyalty is always to their religion 1st and not their country, or anything else. Giving palestine freedom is aka isreal digging its own grave. See how brainless the $T$ are. They made a statement yes but at what cost? The suppression of the Palestinians will be more dire now. The pain for Palestinians will be much greater than ever seen. There are 20+ arab states why do u need a new one?

@ truly magical place. Shameful that they get barely any support. It is fun, welcoming, cultural and food is fantastic. My friends family are Christians in Lebanon next to Muslim neighbourhood — each Christmas, Muslims could put up a Christmas tree 🌲 at crossroads to show friendship. They all did same for diff cultural holidays. Iran and $T$ destroyed this symbol to the world

It’s no secret that $T$ is Iranian backed. Mossad even went into Iran to kill some $T$ people and Iran only responded by saying the equivalent of “We’ll get you back for this”. They’ve reacted in a similar way to this, too.they don’t seem to care much if the link is made.

Don't worry. I'm pretty sure these were special pagers that only $T$ was using. The theory is that they were quietly purchased or upgraded some months back and part of their battery was replaced with explosives. Basically, now everyone knows who the $T$ people are in the community and the community will not be want a $T$ fighter anywhere near them after this explosion. You've gotta hand it to whoever came up with this idea, though.

It is not IDFs fault... if you are dealing with unreasonable monster. IDF soldiers are risking their lives but other factors come in, pressure from the US, etc.... if IDF were allowed to do it without restraint, it is possible the hostage crisis would have been over. Remember also how cunning and treacherous is $T$... Israel and its government/leaders are placed in a very tight position. But you have the right leaders at this time of crisis. Israel knows it must decide for the welfare of its nation and people, though it has to think also of the hostages. Not an enviable situation to be in.

Top army officials deemed IOF incompetent during the 2006 Israel-$T$ War/Lebanon-Israeli Conflict. They published academic reports and studies on the ground and so forth to create an objective, official US military report on the IOF in that war. They said, verbatim, the [IOF] strategically lost the war and were “unprepared to fight a real war” with $T$. This was the official report from the IS Government. It’s no different here. The Hasbara machine is covering up the truth that the IOF is losing the ground war against the Palestinian resistance wing of their former government. The Zio-Israelis army is unable to fight a real ground war with an organized real army, so they go around the opposing army and attack it by destroying its cultural and socioeconomic, legal, and political infrastructures AND PEOPLE. They’re experts at murdering abducting torturing children, but unable to actually fight a direct war against a real army. They are the most incompetent, immoral occupation force ever. They are not an army; they’re an occupation police force. Our police are trained by your incompetent occupation soldiers, which explains why our police are the most incompetent, useless, corrupt, violent goons. We’re all informed by our research and body of knowledge, and our praxis is based on love, mercy, kindness, and compassion. Amen!

There where no jews in Gaza...ok. What if the Palastines used electricity, water, feul, medicine as a wapon like Israël does? Israël has been cutting of Gaza from everything for 75 years. The Dutch and French once built a harbor in Gaza so the people of Palastine could trade with the world. Guess what Israël did when the harbor was finished.... they bombed it to oblivion because Israël does not want the Palastines to be developed like them. Would you not foght back if your homes where taken by others? When your resources are kept being cut of for no other reason than hatred from other people who do not even belong there? Ofcourse you would fight back and that is what Palastine does in my opinion. The resistance in Europe during ww2 would be the same for nazi Germany as $T$ is to Israël.

It is always about Israel launching missiles and rockets - how bout $T$! Don’t be single-sided and biased in your information.

🤬🇪🇦 Every time I see the Nazis of the Israeli Zionist SS mocking their Palestinian victims within their territory where they have entered by force committing genocide and all kinds of atrocities against unarmed Palestinians because, they have never fought hand to hand with $T$ so, The strength of the Nazi Zionist Israeli SS, which propagandists call a powerful army when they have never fought against anyone on equal terms, has not been demonstrated, I cannot contain my disgust and contempt towards them, towards the mafia of the governments of the United Kingdom, USA, the EU, Canada, Australia and the members of the UN mafia nations that collaborated for the creation of an artificial Israeli state that should never have existed, much less before a legitimate Palestinian state existed with its Palestinian population with own identity that has always been in its legitimate territory of Palestine, that shows that the UN was created not to defend human rights but to invent an artificial Israeli state, that is why it began by failing to comply with its own articles, violating the human rights of the Palestinians. those who left without homes or territories to give them to some Zionist occupiers brought from Europe, therefore, the UN collaborated in the condition of forcibly displaced, apartheid and refugees of the Palestinians for 75 years, subtly hiding that collaboration by delivering humanitarian aid that without the participation of the UN, the Palestinians would not have had humanitarian needs and would live in peace, cultivating their lands and managing their natural resources that are being plundered by the expansionist Nazism of Israeli Zionist terrorism, very aberrant no matter how you look at it.

​@ is the one occupating and not the other way around. Israel received more UN-resolutions than all the countries in the world combined not the other way around. You're missing the point big time. 29 November: Resolution 3246: Affirms the legitimacy of armed resistance by oppressed peoples in pursuit of the right to self-determination, and condemns governments which do not support that right. What does that UN-resolution say ? So to ask ' What about $T$ ? ' is like asking ' What about the European Resistance ' against the Nazi's during WW2. I always learned to start on page 1 when i read a book. $T$ is definitely the legitimate Palestinian Resistance. By far

I want you to answer my questions, how do you think $T$ was created, how was it born? Why was it born? The same questions for ISIS and Taliban. I'll tell you why, America invades the middle eastern countries then leaves it in shambles with houses destroyed, families destroyed, the economy destroyed. Then from all that useless destruction comes an angry group of people who are called the "terrorists" instead in their own countries are known as the resistance group to stop other countries from exploiting and invading. Just like when there was no WMD in Iraq

They took 200 hostages back into Palestine, did the $T$ think Israel would do nothing the sad part about this is they started the war now they’re complaining that they’re in the war. There’s one way to stop the killing. If all the hostages are returned all the civilized world would lean very hard on Israel to cease fire and back off.

The name Palestine comes not from $T$, but from the Philistines, which originated as an immigrant group from the Aegean that settled in Canaan circa 1175 BC during Late Bronze Age collapse. The Philistines are known for their biblical conflict with the Canaanite peoples of the region, in particular, the Israelites. The Arabs that call themself $T$, came just in the 7th century ( about 2000 years later), and got this name from the geographic name, that was used by the Roman Authorities during this time (Byzantine Period). It's why this land is not named after the $T$ but vice versa. And they are guests there. Learn history! In 1948 (and later on) they have decided to fight against the Israelis and were beaten again and again. Just don't fight! 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱

So what is happening is: israeli illegal state zionists claims all $T$ are animals, and they will cut off food water electricity. (Against jeneva convention- but doesn't get punished) 🇵🇸 fights them because israel slowly killing $T$ and Palestine as a country is not even on the maps anymore, people live like in concentration camps. 🇮🇱 claims hamas kills innocent people, yet do not provide any footages where hamas kills civilians(except first attack on militarized parts of occupied land) people: believe it. 🇵🇸 claims israel kills not hamas but ordinary civilians and they provide info to back it up, (as we all saw how hamas takes captives and not beat them up and kills them as israel state does) 🇮🇱 claims hamas kills children: doesn't show their bodies (skin color etc.), only black bags 🇵🇸 claims they killed 15000+ children, backs it up with photos of $T$ with their children, shows photos of damages children's bodies had in hospitals after air strikes. (Against war laws of modern world - but again doesn't get punished) and we can see that children and infants are palestinians, i mean, their mothers are there. 🇮🇱 attacks more than 20 hospitals in a big period of time, then attacks an ahl bayt hospital, shares it on X, then deletes it from x, and starts claiming it was $T$ who attacked hospital. So, who is a terrorist? It seems very much likely that terrorists are 🇮🇱, because of Talmud and it's inhuman laws of treatment of non-jew (check on the internet) My opinion, based on numerous claims of 🇮🇱 and 🇵🇸 and information they provided to back up their claims. (Israel didn't)

@ ​No u dumb2, $T$ have way more semitic DNA than the israelies today. Israelies today have a vast majority of european DNA coz israelies today, their ancestors are khazarians from the khazar kingdom back in ancient europe who then converted to judaism. They have no rights in the palestine, they all must leave at once and go back to europe where their khazarian ancestors came from. Bibi, yoav galant, isaac herzog, etc had previously european birth names, but then changed their names into more jewish-like sounding names they use today 🤥👺. Whilist the $T$ are mixed blooded between arabs and descendants of Moses and Aaron's followers who came first to the land following those two prophets across the sea, chased down by pharaoh who drowned there from ancient egypt. And the arabs are the descendents of Ishmael the bio son of Abraham who also the father of Isaac from different mums, they grew up together and Isaac was the elder bro who is the ancestor of jewish people. Who then converted to christianity, then eventually to islam, because moses was about 1000 years to Jesus, and Jesus was about 600 years to Mohamed. Israeli author, professor I forgot his name, said the israelites today aren't the same with the ancient hebrew people led by moses, totaly different DNA. So israelites today are not the descendents of jewish people who got expelled from the land and scatered all over the world. Truly💯, their homeland is europe, just like americans, canadians, australians today.

convert to Judaism and become an Israeli its as simple as that, there is no national israeli identity since most of them are from different parts of Europe, so it's only Judaism and Zionism is what connects them, convert to Judaism and take israeli nationality in 1 week, under the law of return of israel, israel has no citizens, all Jews and specially Zionist jews from all parts of earth, regardless of there nationality and culture and traditions and heritage and race are its citizens, that's it. So Binjamin Klowsky being Israeli ambassador to the U.S isn't something big, nor it's important, $T$ have a clearly strong national identity and history and heritage as a nation, Israelis, on the other hand, most of them are European Settlers that only Judaism and Zionism is what connects them, they don't have a national identity. And his Polish origins are clear and original name is clear, him faking his name means nothing, ill still call him by his real nationality and real name. For example, Ethiopian Jews are Black Africans by race and culture and heritage and traditions, yet, they are all citizens of israel, German Jews, are White Europeans by race and culture and heritage and history, yet, they are israels citizens, it's as simple as that, they don't have a national identity, it's only Zionism that connects them, 98% of Israelis are dual nationality holders, they have there original nationality of there real countries, and israeli nationality for being Zionist Jew's by religion, so they don't have a national identity, most of there food is stolen is stolen from indigenous levantine cultures like Lebanese and Syrians and $T$ and Jordanians, as all of us know, Hummus and Shawarma and Sheesh Tawooq and etc are unique arabic dishes unique only to levant cultures, Israelis don't have a literal history or identity, Zelensky can go tomorrow and take israeli citizenship in 1 week.

​@'t be an utter idiot. Israel has been doing this for over 70 years, and Hamas never existed then. There are no hostages or Hamas in the West Bank and Israel has killed hundreds upon hundreds of $T$ and locked up over 9000 without charges. The thousands and thousands of men, women, children held for months, years, decades in Israeli prisons WITHOUT charges, WITHOUT trials, are hostages of Israel. Lawyers cannot even defend them as they are not charged with anything. 2023 before Oct 7, Israel had killed many many in Gaza. Maybe if Israel stopped being an occupying apartheid country dead set on taking all the land by force since the 1880s, people wouldn't need to resist, eh? Do try to pay attention. Israel has NEVER said they'd stop killing children, arresting people without cause, stealing land, if hostages were returned or never taken, or cities attacked. They still want Gaza Jewish, with only Jews and tourists on the Gaza beaches.

@ is total BS. What makes $T$ culturally unique from Syrians, Jordanians, or Egyptians? Before Israel independence, there were never “$T$” nor demand for Palestine statehood. While Jews fought thousands of years for their independence, “$T$” were created by the borders that were drawn by British colonizers. If the borders were drawn differently, “$T$” can easily become Egyptians, Syrians, or Jordanians as their neighbours just a border away.

@ Israel's massacres are much more frequent, larger in scale, have been happening for many years, and sometimes even more brutal in nature than what Hamas did. For you to only start caring when an israeli is harmed after decades of $T$ being attacked is either because YOU don't see $T$ as human beings, or you only see the public, sugarcoated, PG version side of israel. There's another side. It's a much more sinister side. A side that journalists lose their careers if they even hint at it. Trust me. When I care about $T$ more than Israelis, that's a natural reaction because, objectively, everything hamas did pales in comparison to everything israel did. It's like a drop in a bucket in comparison. If you truly know everything israel has ever done, you need to take a deep look in the mirror about dehumanisation.

(Against war laws of modern world - but again doesn't get punished) and we can see that children and infants are palestinians, i mean, their mothers are there. 🇮🇱 attacks more than 20 hospitals in a big period of time, then attacks an ahl bayt hospital, shares it on X, then deletes it from x, and starts claiming it was $T$ who attacked hospital. So, who is a terrorist? It seems very much likely that terrorists are 🇮🇱, because of Talmud and it's inhuman laws of treatment of non-jew (check on the internet) My opinion, based on numerous claims of 🇮🇱 and 🇵🇸 and information they provided to back up their claims.

For all the comments that condemn Israel... it's easy for this channel to fool you and lie to you. The facts are simply not true. Since you see Muslim people speaking Arabic in the video, you believe that it is a Palestinian who was shot by an Israeli policeman on nationalistic grounds. Well... In Israel there is a diversity of cultures and people... so even if a situation of criminal conflict between two people happens it is easy to interpret it as a nationalistic injustice. Just like this channel does here. The shooter is Christian Israeli policeman and the murdered is an Israeli Muslim Arab who volunteers in the MDA and not in USAID (Cheap propaganda of this channel ) . This is exactly a conflict between two Israelis citizens!!!! (a Christian and a Muslim). Did you notice that there is not even the faintest connection to the $T$?? What happened is that appears to be a parking dispute between the two. Of course, the unfortunate event is being investigated with the full rigor of the law by the law authorities. In conclusion, to all those who are driven by hate and trying to find justification to defame Israel... try harder...

How dare anyone calls Izrahell the only democratic countries in Middle East, when it has in its own backyard one the most cruel brutal tyrannies in the world!! Can you be half pregnant? Can you be democracy in the front and tyranny in the back??? Izraehell has three sets of regims: 1st Izrahelli law is for Izrahelli citizens which is a civil court, liberal system, freedom of speech and freedom of traveling and this covers all Izrahelli towns, and Izrahelli 1lligal settlements in the West Bank. 2nd set of regime, is very discriminative regime against Arab Izrahell, the Arab of 1948, the Izrahelli citizens who are $T$ which are 20% of the population 1.5 million. They are discriminated in any possible aspect of life but they gain formal equal civil rights, they vote, they elect, they can be voted and they can be elected. There is 30 laws discriminate against them. 3rd is for the military regime in the occupied territory which is one of the most brutal cruel tyrannies on earth which covers Westbank (Janine, Nablus, Tul Karam, Qalqeeliah, Baitlahem, Hibron.) About 4 million $T$, Which is a military court and is an ap system in regards court (military court), Health Insurance, schools and road regulation (exclusive for jews use) on foot or in cars. There is an education system that teaches racism to make life unlivable for $T$. And of course comes Gazza, which is basically a conc3ntration camp and now after October 7 became a de camp! This law views all Gazans as terr0rists controlling all their livelihood. providing them with only four hours of electricity a day that was before October 7 and water ( 90% not sufficient for human use) in addition to systematic b0mbing every couple of years which is known as mowing the lawn.

IF Allah is YHWH, the God of Abraham (which he is not), why were the $T$ not given wisdom that as consequence to what Hamas will do, almost all of their structures will be destroyed, because they agreed for Hamas to build their tunnels undeneath them. God promised **His exiled people, Israel** that they will be returned to their homeland, and never to be uprooted again, Amos 9:14-15. And it happened, 1940's.

The tons of earth that were created by digging tunnel systems were not carried out by the $T$ in their pockets and disposed of somewhere in the back garden.

You are so miseducated, naive, misinformed. First of all, Gaza is of Palestinian rule, not by Israel (we saw how that worked out). Gaza is the worst dictatorship in the world, yes, worse than North Korea. Besides, is this what you have to say in this terrible time. Do not be confused, Hamas started the attacks, Hamas has tortured, massacred, abducted, burned alive, and executed innocent elderly, children and babies. Hamas is a terror group. Hamas didn't start this to free $T$, Hamas started this because they're a bunch of primitive and barbaric animals, fueled with anger hate (and stupidity). The amount of war crimes and crimes against humanity Hamas committed in this war will not be forgotten.

If Gaza freedom fighters arrests police and IDF near garrisons of Gaza and bombs at settlers who by force occupied the land in 1970s. Farm land that was belong to $T$ now called Ashkalon etc etc..?? Its all terrorism? Savagery? Disgusting? And needs to be wiped out from face of earth? Massacred?

[The $T$] are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to [humanitarian agency] OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.

@ what $T$ did on october 7th was a RESPONSE TO 75 YEARS of OPPRESSION, GENOCIDE, INVASION OF THEIR LAND BY ISREAL, GETTING KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUT IN CONCENTRATION CAMPs. now you TELL ME what what country would accept being invaded and massacred like that??russia?china? if you expect isreal to retaliate than you should expect the same from the people who suffered more and longer and were attacked FIRST. atleast most $T$ targets are soldiers unlike isreal which so far killed mostly CHILDREN

Why? So the $T$ can go through Israel and butcher the Jews again? Have Hamas surrender and the Palestinian people swear allegiance to Israel and then in time they can be integrated into Israeli society. But as of right now that’s impossible. Calling for a ceasefire guarantees that it’ll never happen until there’s another war. The $T$ legit need to get away from Muslim extremists and be re-educated. Then there will be hope for a one state solution. But you cannot have a large amount of $T$ who believe they’re rewarded in death and want nothing more but to kill Jews free in Israel. That’s just common sense. Especially when the PLO will pay the person’s family more money per month than they would make in a year working a legitimate job. You guys seem to not care at all about Israeli citizens.

Why? So they can have round 2 of what they did on October 7th? 80% of $T$ support Hamas. If Hamas surrenders and the $T$ swear allegiance to Israel then in time they’ll be free. But if they continue to butcher any Jew they get their hands on then they won’t be free and they shouldn’t be allowed to be free. They can’t even condemn what happened on October 7th. Why should they be free if they’re obviously a threat to society by justifying such violence.

​@ may be DONT HAVE PARADE NEAR BORDER OF $T$ DURING A WAR?? Bc that's not only extremely desrescpectful to victims but your own government fired at is-not-real citizens. Also your so suffering when you've not only lived a life smiles and Islamophobia. Meanwhile Palestinians and Lebanese have never not had a day were they weren't shot bombed and lost family members at young age due to is-not-real war crimes. If Hamas is to blame for this then let's look back at history for abit. This started in 1948 when is-not-real kicked out thousands Palestinians from their homes with UN soldiers, when UN left according to UN documents is-not-real immediately took more land then originally agreed to. Hamas was started in 1978 and at the time had no means to terrorize. Let's not forget that Hamas was also THE ONLY POLITICAL PARTY TO VOTE FOR. that means that they would have won by default anyways. And if is-not-real has the time to be oppressed and stuff then why did they have the time to illegally cross Lebanese borders and raid THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT HOUSEHOLDS, dont you dare tell me that didn't happen since my dad was a kid at the time and watched it all go down. I literally know a reporter who went to talk about this in Gaza and when the live was turned off she was bombed she didnt survive. Kids die every day over their and your here complaining about a parade. Is this seriously your best argument, were showing literal dead kids who are trapped in plastic wrap instead of a coffin or properly buried because there's no space. People wait in lines to have their dead kids wrapped in plastic wrap. I also hope that you know when Hamas freed is-not-real hostages your government literally shot them mistaking them for Palestinians. And according to your government literally a hospital was a Hamas base and the arabic calendar was the names of Hamas soldiers 😑💀.

In March 2019 , Netanyahu told his Likud colleagues : " Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas ... This is part of our strategy - to isolate the $T$ in Gaza from the $T$ in the West Bank”. So help me understand why Netanyahu isn't responsible for everything that has happened. Business Insider : Netanyahu said to a group of Israelis, " America is a thing you can move very easily , move it in the right direction. They won't get in their way. " And this was what he was saying back in 2001, also available to see on YouTube.

Notice she used the word “ martyred “ instead of murdered. Some of you need to understand that $T$ are conditioned from a young age to die for Islam. They are taught to kill Jews. The mothers sacrifice their young boys for that cause. Please look up Palestinian propaganda. There is more to this than what you are being lead to believe.

@.Nadeem see my past comments i have stated things from 1948 when arab nations rejected UN resolutions and launched war against a newsly formed state of israel. If everyone has accepted UN resolution in 1948, both israel and Palestine would have remained praceful. But three times arab nation around attack israel and three time they were defeated. If u are victorious in war, u r victor and then u dictate the terms of negotiations. Just like turks won Turkey and Constantinople (present day istanbul) from Romans(Byzantines) and still keep its even today. I think all arab nations should have accepted the resolution in 1948 and welcomed jews and israel. Instead of wahing war, and promising palestines that they will return and take back whole of palestine and return them back, they should have all worked upon a negioatted settled based on principle of humanity and peace. Even in camp david , israel and plo were just a step away from final settlement but it is all history now. U can see many documentaries on this. What i realised is that whenever anyone from Palestine or israel try to reach a peaceful negotiation, some extremist would kill or bomb and make the environment and emotions opposite to peace. In this case even a jew extremist killed an israeli prime minister who was signatory of oslo accord and even then hamas did bus bombings. U have to understand, initially Arab nation used palestine and $T$ as a tool for pan arab movement till 1980 and after then plo continued its terrorist actions until 1993 in oslo accord. And every time $T$ or arab nations indulged in violenece, israel retaliated back with more violence and more illegal settlement and restrictions in areas in Palestine territory... But $T$ are refusing to learn the lesson and they have paid the heavist price...i think $T$ were used as tools by aran leaders to look more muslim or islamic in eyes of their population. I must remind u , no arab nation or muslim nation took Israel into ICJ. It is south africa and now Nicaragua. U cannot win by force and therefore a peace settlement is best option. But if $T$ are still going to use force , they must be ready to pay the price as history has shown many times again and again ... This is not the first time israel is attacking palestine after a terrorist attack in its soil. Iran gave resources and motivation to Hamas to attack Israel to sabotage Abraham Accord and Hamas leader did the act knowing fully well what Israelis had done in past for any such incident. If u really do deep research in this subject, u will understand that everyone is just using $T$ and they think they are getting martyred but i think they are just meaningles dying as chess pieces of bigger stronger powers including iran, israel, turkey, uae, usa , etc.. Palestinians people should understand this and stop themselves being used by anyone even by Hamas.

@ AGAIN, just because they didn't have what we consider to be proper states, does NOT mean anything. When the Ottomans were defeated, the land was officially recognized as MANDATORY Palestine, meaning that it was MANDATORY that the land would be the Palestinian state. The British came in at what was supposed to be an advisory capacity until the $T$ were equipped to function independently. However, the British ILLEGALLY incorporated the Balfour Declaration into the Mandate making Israel illegitimate and $T$ the sovereigns of the land. Dr. Ralph Wilde gave an extremely eloquent and easily understood speech before the ICJ. If you haven't seen it, it's really interesting.

@ FIRST and foremost- the IOF are responsible for a large part of the massacre on 10/7. SECOND- how many $T$ are being held hostage in Israeli Military Prisons? And before you show even more ignorance, there are tons of prisoners that haven't been charged with a crime. There are tons that are in there based on fabricated evidence, or just outright lies by the IOF. They've arrested hundreds for peacefully protesting, or for walking down a street that is for Israelis only. They've kidnapped people and thrown them into military prisons for saying things like "prayers for Gaza's children" on their Social Media. Probably less than 30% of the people in Israeli military prisons are actually guilty of a real crime. They lock CHILDREN up in military prison. Do you know that they have a 99% conviction rate?!?! The IOF has beaten, r a p e d, tortured, humiliated, and k i l l e d countless $T$ that are in prison, or that aren't in prison. They have freely admitted to those crimes! These things have been going on for DECADES, and the Palestinian people have tried for decades, to go through the proper legal channels, all to no avail. This didn't start on October 7th, and the world is tired of people trying to use that as justification for Israel committing even more crimes against the $T$.

Last thing, it’s funny how you say “fighting for their rights”, October 7th was a fight against human rights, the intefadas came instead diplomatic solution and made the situation worst, They kidnapped more then 250 of my people, some of them are babies.

​@ the 1916, the world war is raging on. The Ottoman empire is 617 years old and at the brink of collapse. The British and the French had promised the Arabs sovereignty and Arab leadership over the Arab peninsula and the Levant if they helped them defeat the Ottomans. So they helped them. When the British and the French won, the Arabs wanted the land that was promised to them, but little did they know, the British and the French had this little top secret meeting. And in this meeting, it was planned that the captured Ottoman province will be divided into areas of British and French control and influence. The British would receive PALESTINE, Jordan and Southern Iraq while the French would control southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. This was called the Sykes-Picot agreement. Then, the Arabs find out about the agreement and was shocked. They had been bamboozled and tricked. They thought they were fighting a war in order to overthrow their non-Arab Muslim rulers, only to end up with, you guessed it, European colonial rulers instead. Now that the British occupy PALESTINE, something unusual happened back in Europe. The Zionist movement had grown increasingly influential and lobbied hard to support the *mass migration* of Jews to PALESTINE and recognise a Jewish claim to the PALESTINIAN land. And in 1917, Britain, out of nowhere publicly declared its intentions of establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. So the British just gifted Palestine, a country which was made up of 90% Palestinians to European $T$. They gave it just like you would give a box of chocolates. Historians still debate to this day on how or why the British gave Palestine to the $T$. With the British mandate in full swing, mass *European* Jewish immigration meant that more land will be seized and the native PALESTINIAN population grew increasingly worried. The Palestinians demonstrated their concerns to their British overlords but they wouldn't have it. *European* Jewish settlers were on the rise. The British proposed a partition of Palestine and even advised the forceful removal of the Arab population from their homes. And yes this was their plan to resolve the issue. So the Palestinians naturally rejected and revolted against the British. The revolts were crushed violently killing thousands of Palestinians. However, the Palestinians didn't give up and fought for their independence and the British were clearly fed up. So in 1947, the British decided to hand over their responsibility for Palestine to the United Nations. So, basically, they just said: "Here, clean our mess". And so the UN proposed this ridiculous proposal where Palestine would be partitioned into a Jewish and Arab state. Remember, Jews in Palestine only constituted one-third of the population - most of whom arrived from Europe a few years earlier yet in the proposal they were allocated 55% of the land. The Arabs clearly rejected because it's a bad deal and the $T$ accepted. However, here's the catch, the $T$ didn't agree to the proposed borders and *even campaigned for more land.* So they agree to an Israeli state but didn't agree to the size of it so they can just choose it for themselves. By 1948, $T$ militia would storm and capture Palestinian populated villages and cities leaving thousands of Palestinians homeless and landless. The $T$ wanted to seize and cleanse as much land from the Palestine before the British would officially withdraw their forces. And on the same day that they left, the $T$ proclaimed the establishment of the new Israeli state. Overnight, millions of Palestinians lost their country. And if it couldn't get any worse, May 15, 1948 was the darkest days in Palestine's history. The Nakba (The catastrophe). To lose your country, identity and home just like that is something truly horrifying. They had to be ETHNICALLY CLEANSED from their lands and driven into near-total destruction. In conclusion, there were no Israel state before 1948. The British helped the $T$ build a "country for Jews". If that doesn't scream racial superiority, I don't know what will...

@ Well I don't speak for anyone but myself and I am a Zionist, to me it's not a dirty word. Unpacked it is the idea that Jews need and deserve a country of their own, in their ancestral land. Many people who are $T$ believe Jews are somehow better than others, that every inch of some Bible-story greater ancient Israel was promised by God and Jews should conquer it and even kick out the locals (that's maybe 10% of $T$). (I think 1 in 10 people being extremist jerks is about the same % as in every Western country.) Many other zionists are very moderate politically and not especially religious. You'd find that they are more or less like everyone else in the West. To me when you say Israelis express an abhorrent attitude towards anti zionists... But anti zionists would deny Jews the right to be a self- determining people in their ancestral lands... Which you would not deny to any other people (or maybe you would deny self determination to the Kurds? Catakonians? Aborigines?). So maybe anti Zionism is abhorrent to Israelis, and not unreasonably so...

​@ word Zionism comes from the name of the mount in Jerusalem: Mount Zion. The word is also a synonim for Eretz Israel, the Land of Israel. Archeology, History and the Bible learn us that jews are the native population of the land for 3000 years. The land could be dominated by many peoples and for generations was not independent. But there were jews living there. So, following nationalist movements in the 19th century, jews engaged in these movements to have an independent land in their ancient homeland. The name of this national jewish movement was Zionism and those engaged in this movement were the $T$. It's interesting to know that many non jews also engaged the movement to help jews to have a country of their own.

ZIONIST: "BECAUSE I'M A ZIONIST I CAN DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME. THE WORLD AND ALL ITS LAWS ARE ON MY SIDE. I HAVE IMMUNITY EVERYWHERE. EVEN IF I'M NOT JEW AND NOT SEMITIC, BUT ANY CRITICISM OF ME AS A ZIONIST, AGAINST MY FELLOW $T$ AND AGAINST MY IDEOLOGY, IS ANTI-SEMETIC.

@ When the $T$ began moving into Palestine, toward the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire, 2% of the population were Jewish Arabs, native Palestinians. There were 70,000 Christians, a few thousands of other faiths and between 600,000 and a million Muslim Arabs (nomadic groups who had lived there for centuries but not in fixed communities were not counted in the census). Even the British Mandate and the US realised that by creating a Jewish Homeland for those fleeing persecution, they were taking away the Palestinians' land. The hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in what was to be the Jewish Homeland were to be carefully assessed and given "like for like" in compensation ie replacement, supposedly equivalent, land. Instead, the $T$ drove them out before they had been assessed, leaving them destitute, then continued violently stealing more land, intending eventually to seize everything "from the Nile to the Euphrates"and get rid of all the Arabs who belonged there.

In Surat Fater(35) verse 18 Allah The Almighty Creator made that very clear where someone’s Burden is not transferable to someone else period. “Burden”: the burden of the responsibilities of actions. It means: In the sight of Allah The Almighty Creator every one is responsible for his own actions and for no one else’s. There is no possibility that Allah The Almighty Creator will place the burden of one man’s responsibility upon the other, nor is there the possibility that a person will take the burden of another’s responsibility upon himself and get himself seized for the crime committed by the other. There is no such thing as “the Eternal sin” in the religion of Al-Islam which Allah The Almighty Creator bestowed on mankind from the time of their birth.That is The Most Justice that is only found in Al-Islam.

@-7814 We can have our slight differences while agreeing on supporting Palestine and opposing "israel". As for me, I don't condemn the October 7 resistance attack at all, in fact I believe that were it was another people who suffered what palestinians suffered through at the hands of "israel", October 7 would have been far, far more bloody due to the sheer pain that the victims hold inside them. Hamas learnt violence from the "israelis" that have orphaned 85% of them, and yet they still have mercy and humanity despite everything. If not, there would have been more than 1 or 2 babies recorded killed on Oct 7, and there would be far more confusion on whether those babies were killed by the resistance or the IDF's hannibal directive and friendly fire. ...there's also the fact that if $T$ sincerely believe that whoever attacked first deserves retaliation no matter how big or how long, then the uncomfortable truth is that $T$ themselves cannot rightfully condemn Oct 7, since the fact is that "israel" attacked first 76 years ago and ongoing. Not that you see them admit that.

That still doesn’t give Israel the right to carpet bomb $T$.. Your saying like Israel doesn’t have a choice when they can easily minimize civilian deaths while still trying to target Hamas. Israeli leaders openly said they want to nuke and make $T$ a parking lot. They openly called Palestinians animals. Fun fact, Netanyahu said that Israelis are the children of light and Palestinians are the children of dark, do you know who else said that? The Nazis.

Claiming genocide in this case is just a blood label trying make Israel the villains of the time. Genocide is about intent and if that was the case the war would have ended within a day or two and $T$ would be already History. So a right thinking person can't claim Genocide in this case ofcourse not excusing Israel's mistakes in conducting this war. You can hate Israel but accusing it of genocide is preposterous. How would explain the over 2. Million Arab palastinians Israel's serving in every sector of the Israel's political economy. Slander is evil and can not win this war. What is needed now is genuineness and a sobbery balanced view in the current situation to quench extremes on both sides. A middle ground must be found and cut and established as the centre of gravity for peace

@ Hama$ is destroyed. Their 4 remaining "battalions" were in Rafa and 2 are decimated. The other 2 were ordered to evac w/the populace w/the intention of preserving them for future governance of $T$.

Bibi Nutanyahu , once again, is speaking pure rhetoric, propaganda, and anti Palestine dogma with the odor of mendacity . Please note that protesting against the genocide in $T$ or zionism is not anti- Israel nor anti-Semitic. Bibi appears to be spreading ignorance and fairy tales . This speech was read with a lot of passion but sounds llike a silly Michael Johnson speech which defies the truth. I especially liked the story of the Israeli soldier who recentky lost his legs, arms and eyes in an explosion fighting in $T$ Hamas militants but now has returned to active military duty as a tank commander . This is an amazing act of sacrifice and bravery for a war that Israel has already lost. Bibi wants more money without restrictions for genocide in $T$ along with more financial support for a war that he knows Israel could never win alone .However, there is now no more money for jobless or homeless Americans but more money for other unwinnable foreign West Asian wars while the American economy falls apart helping the defense contractors and the Israeli lobby. This appears to be a serious conflict of interest that should be investigated as a threat to true American interests.

A significant amount of United States governors , mayors , county officials and university presidents are using police to violently and unjustly restrict the First Amendment Constitutional rights of peaceful United States citizens or residents that are protesting against the genocidal military actions of the Israeli government..However, the mentioned restrictions against them have not been reasonably related to legitimate goals, such as reducing a true identifiable security risk as per the law and are also preventing substantially more expression of protest than is necessary to achieve those goals, as they appear to be motivated by the dislike of the protesters' message. The mentioned restrictions do not allow protesters to adequately voice their view points without brutal police crack down by government leaders apparently receiving large sums of money from the war industry and the zionist state of Israel . A significant number of Americans protesting regarding the genocide in $T$ believe that there are local, State, and federal officers who are selling their office for personal gain and thereby shattering public trust in government officials. “Unfortunately, this crime unfairly tarnishes the honest officers who serve the public with honesty , true Godly values and dedication day in as well as day out.

Lack of understanding of the Middle East. Pitfalls at the highest level! To say "they want to live in his honor and in peace". They mean the Jewish people and Israel. They are not ready to recognize the state of Israel. I wonder if Dave has read the Hamas charter, the Fatah charter (the "moderates"), the Palestinian national anthem... I wonder if he knows the difference between Shia and Sunnah. ), Jihad (Jihad) and the Battle of Badr (Badr invasion). I wonder if Dave knows that the schools in the Palestinian Authority (and also in $T$) teach language, physics, chemistry, art, homeland - always with the connotation of the Jewish enemy that needs to be murdered. To be a shahid (martyr) - to die a martyr's death - is a commandment for them. I wonder if Dave saw how from first grade they have weapons and combat lessons that teach them to murder Jews. I wonder if Dave knows that the Palestinian Authority (not in $T$) has 78% support for Hamas after 7/10. I wonder if Dave knows that before 7/10 85% of the Palestinians in $T$ were in Hamas and the Hamas approach. I wonder if Dave knows that the Nahua (terrorists from $T$) on 7/10 knew very well that they were murdering, raping, burning, beheading and abusing precisely the peace-loving people who helped them and gave them jobs, and took care of them - there are pictures of the refrigerators and doors of Kibbutz Bari with stickers of "peace now" they enter and brutally murder them. I wonder if he is Dave that every house in the PA has weapons and ammunition under children's beds and in children's rooms. And that the "Metro" of $T$ is twice as big as the London Metro. that the shafts and headquarters sit under hospitals, schools, mosques. I wonder if Dave knows why the Palestinians did not agree to the "Partition Plan" (1947), why they did not implement the Oslo Agreement (1993), why they did not agree to the agreements at the Camp David Conference (2000), why they did not agree to Olmert's proposals (2006), Why did they not agree to the Arab peace initiative (2007). It is interesting that they say "2 states for 2 peoples" what was the intention for Israel to agree to learning but there is no requirement for the Palestinians to recognize Israel's lesson... The Palestinians have never agreed to 2 states but only to one state. They state this openly: "From the river to the sea - everything is ours". I wonder if Dave knows what Hezbollah's, Iran's statements are. I wonder if he knows the logo of the Houthis and what it says there. I'll make it simple: "Allah is the greatest, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam" We - the Israelis, in school sang: "Sing a song for peace", we sang "I was born for peace", we learned about "Rabin's legacy", in our national anthem it says "to be a free people in our country" - everything exploded in our faces on 7/10. There will not be a Palestinian state because they do not recognize the state of Israel. point. This is not Israel's problem. They will decide what they want - Israel's hand will be established. Dave and the world is doing what we all did up until 7/10...trying to accommodate advanced and western logic to something that doesn't behave like this. It is to rape Western logic on something that does not behave like Western logic.

And yea i know this aint the start of their history but the start of the current war and it was started by hamas by mainly killing civilians which btw isnt just iraeli propaganda. And if u say „ israel is killing children as well“. Why? Cause those hamas trashpeople hide behind human shields and dont wear uniforms so u cant destinguish them from civilians. If u want the war to be over, then free the hostages its as simple as that. And no im not an „istaeli sheep“ i have many friends from Palestine who will tell me by far the worst entity in $T$ is hamas. They are the main reasons israel treats $T$ as they treat them. Of course there are those people in the israeli goverment that support the settlers which in my eyes are completely legitimate targets btw.

Disagree with you! Since 1968 Israel has demonstrated pure genocide towards the Arabs of $T$ and the West Bank. Indiscriminately shooting civilians, restricting movements of the people, restricting access to clean water and electricity in $T$. In the West Bank allowing Jewish settlers to kill and destroy Arabs homes and bulldozing their homes just so they can build Jewish settlements in their place. How are the Arabs to respond to such Pure Evil?! The Isreali Government has used Hamas as a excuse to commit genocide. Why did the IDF kill hostages??

@ Israel had to act in $T$ in self-defense to hostilities initiated - and prolonged - by Hamas. In clear violation of international law, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in $T$ fired approximately 3,500 rockets, indiscriminate weapons that target Israeli civilians. Tunnels dug from $T$ were used to carry out terror attacks inside Israeli territory. Since the beginning of Operation Protective Edge, Israel has respected numerous ceasefires. Most of these were humanitarian lulls for the benefit of the residents of $T$. Prior to the 10-13 August ceasefire, Hamas violated every ceasefire and humanitarian lull. Even a lull initiated by Hamas was promptly violated by the terrorists themselves. Hamas also violated the 15 July ceasefire initiated by Egypt and supported by most of the international community, including the Arab League. Israel accepted this ceasefire. Had Hamas accepted it as well, Israel would not have had to start its ground operation and a full 90% of the fatalities in this conflict would have been avoided. This same ceasefire was accepted later by Hamas on 5 August.

@ read Qur'an .. u will get clarity.. the word jews and israel is mentioned in Quran.. that land belongs to jews .. Judaism is 3500 years and Islam is 1400 years old ..get your facts right .. also Palestine, Hamas terrorist group has warned people - "❌ Israel's attack is just the first beginning. One by one we will bring the entire earth under our control and Muslim Sharia law. Only worship of Allah will remain on earth, we will not allow any other religion to exist on earth and we will do all this ❌" Till now, more than 40 infants have been beheaded, and many children have been taken hostage. They humiliated the women and raped them, took many women with them to $T$ Strip. They decapitated them, stripped them, left them with their headless bodies in the middle of the intersection, after their death, raped the dead bodies, and are making videos of this massacre and sending it to the Israeli government. Brutally murdered elderly citizens. They kept 150+ civilians hostage in $T$ Strip. A henius crime of Killings a fully pregnant woman and cutting her womb out of her body .. the newborn die on road .. the umbilical cord was still attached to the mother when the child was beheaded after being taken out by Hamas terrorists.. and many more endless atrocities.. just think about it.. not a single atrocity of this level was ever done by israel people on Muslims. Not a single.. not a single ..never ..

Not all Palestinians are terrorists yet Israel is targeting an entire people. I am not condoning Hamas, they are terrorists, but I do not agree or support Israel's retaliation on an entire civilisation. Israel say they are bombing Hamas positions yet they are targeting residential areas, hospitals, civilian infrastructure - this is an annihilation of the Palestinian people. Britain should be calling for Israel to halt their war on $T$, not supporting it.

Because Egypt would have oppressed them even more than Israel did, if not massacred them. A lot of them actually fled from North Africa to $T$ long time ago. That's why a lot of arabs live in Israel to begin with. They'd rather be treated like trash in Israel than be massacred in other Arab countries...plus $T$ people are very hard to deal with as you have noticed the last few days.

Here's some facts: 1) $T$ is free. Israel left in 2005... 2) the only reason Israel got gaza and the west bank is because of the war of 1967 instigated by the arabic side 3) from 1948 til 1967 Egypt occupied $T$ and Jordan occupied the West bank... I didn't see people like you calling out occupation! And even before the occupation that started in 1967 countless of terror attacks where launched against Israel from $T$ and the west bank. 4) former pm begin offered gaza to Egypt and was refused. 5) 1920's about twenty years before Israel declared independence Jews where massacred by arabs in what is known as the hebron massacre. So if the arab countries that occupied gaza abd the west bank cared for them so much and had ample of time why didn't they let them form thier country? And as i showed you terror against jews started long before the occupation or Israel declared independence. If you support what hamas did and you don't feel sickening by it you should check yourself

@-wn9to Judestaten manifesto called for Jews to take it all “circumspectly” in Herzl’s words. 100x’s worse with ‘protect themselves’ gazacaust. Everyone has a right to stand their ground to protect themselves and their families’. Illegal occupation existed for 20 years before Hamas came around. No illegal occupation, 💨 no Hamas simple. No one thinks $T$ apocalypse is about the symptom of Hamas…it is about the evil Occupation of Jerusalem and the whole of Palestine and an opportunity to leverage Judestaten dreams much faster than ‘circumspectly’. See, we agree! Viva Judestaten by any means necessary. Unit 2100?

Because Egypt and Israel wanted to be protected from Hamas attacks they put the blockade around $T$. Hamas made $T$ a hell for Palestinians, Hamas don't provide them any water or electricity even when it has billions!
